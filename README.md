# pomo

A user-friendly note-taking application.

## motivations

> This is a passion project born out of a desire to learn Svelte. I want to focus on accessibility, performance, and
> clean UX.

- improved performance compared to popular alternatives
- export notes to multiple formats, including standalone HTML
- support for no-JS clients on public sheets

> I'd like pomo to be capable of exporting sheets as a single, functional HTML bundle. In a way, it could be used as a
> sort of static-site generator, ideally with theming/layout capabilities.

- support for embedding many content types: code, links, media, etc

## usage

Currently, no publicly-available instance of pomo exists.
However, downloading and running pomo locally is fairly simple;

- `git clone` this repository
- run `npm install` to download project dependencies
- run `npm run dev` to start a development server
- run `npm run build` to create a production build
- run `npm run preview` to preview a production build
